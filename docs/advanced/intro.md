# Introduction to Advanced Prompts

Some tasks are more difficult than others for AI, for example, to analyze files that are very big or have a complex layout, out of the box solutions might not be good enough.

You can browse the agents below and copy-paste prompts directly into your flows, custom GPTs, or embedded Copilots.

## How to Use

1. Each page represents a different Copilot Agent or AI use case.
2. Prompts are written to be reusable and modular.
3. Customize prompts in Copilot Studio by modifying entities, system instructions, or chaining steps.

Explore the agent prompts to get started.
